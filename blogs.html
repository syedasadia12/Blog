          <p>Hawaii (Hawaiian: Hawai‚Äòi) is a group of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands lie 2,397 miles from San Francisco, California, to the east and 5,293 miles from Manila, in the Philippines, to the west. The capital is Honolulu, located on the island of Oahu. The islands were annexed by the United States in 1900, and as a U.S. territory saw population expansion and the establishment of a plantation system for growing sugar cane and pineapples. On the morning of December 7, 1941, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor near Honolulu. The surprise attack destroyed nearly 20 vessels, killed more than 2,000 American soldiers and propelled the United States into World War II. Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state on August 21, 1959.</p>
          <p>People go there to see historical site such as Pearl Harbor. There are six  main islands in Hawaii anyone can visit. </p>

          <h3>Dubai</h3>
          <p>It was love at first sight for us in Dubai. From the moment we left the airport, 
            Dubai was one big wow. We posted about our fantastically fun camel-riding, belly-dancing, dune-jumping adventure in the desert. 
            We‚Äôve told you about the cultural heritage tour that took us beyond the glitz into the living heart of Old Dubai. 
            I may have mentioned, more than once, what an incredible experience seeing the dancing fountains at the Burj Kalifa was.

          <p> Famous for spring break and beach getaways, Cancun is a city in Mexico that many have heard of. Down on the Caribbean coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, it‚Äôs Zona Hotelera beachfront is full of resorts, restaurants and nightlife.

          <h3>Florida</h3>
          <p>  Now, first things first, Florida‚Äôs sheer size can be something of a trek, especially if you‚Äôre heading all across the state. Honestly, you can easily spend a week or two exploring and still not have covered half of the best places in Florida. Though, I always use this as an excuse to return! üòâ
